# Asset Management Dashboard Documentation

## Introduction
The Asset Management Dashboard is a web application built with Next.js 13, Prisma, and Firebase authentication. It focuses on managing carbon credits and carbon credit ETFs. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for tracking and assessing projects related to carbon credits.

## Features

### 1. Server and Client Components
The Asset Management Dashboard utilizes Next.js 13's server and client component architecture. The `ProjectAssessmentDashboard` component is a client component, allowing for interactive functionality and state management.

### 2. Prisma Integration
The dashboard integrates with a PostgreSQL database using Prisma. The Prisma schema defines the data models for the application, including `PendingProjects`, `Portfolio`, `Investor`, and `Project_Details`. This enables efficient data management and querying.

### 3. Firebase Authentication
User authentication is handled using Firebase. This ensures secure access to the dashboard and protects sensitive project information.

### 4. Project Assessment Dashboard
The main feature of the dashboard is the Project Assessment Dashboard. It displays a table with project details, including the project name, ICOS status, SDG validity, SDV validity, and overall status. This allows users to quickly assess the progress and status of each project.

### 5. Add New Project
The dashboard provides a button to add new projects. Clicking on the "Add New Project" button redirects the user to the `/sb/addProject` page, where they can enter the details of a new project.

### 6. Fetch Projects from API
The `ProjectAssessmentDashboard` component fetches project data from an API endpoint (`/api`) using the `fetch` function. The retrieved data is then stored in the component's state using the `useState` hook and displayed in the table.

### 7. Error Handling
The dashboard includes error handling for failed API requests. If the API request fails, an error message is logged to the console.

### 8. Responsive Design
The dashboard is built using Material-UI components, which provide a responsive design out of the box. The `TableContainer` component ensures that the table is responsive and scrollable on smaller screens.

## Suggested Features

### 1. Carbon Credit Tracking
Implement a feature to track the carbon credits associated with each project. Display the total carbon credits earned and the remaining credits available for each project.

### 2. Carbon Credit Marketplace
Create a marketplace section where users can buy and sell carbon credits. Implement a trading system that allows users to place orders and execute trades.

### 3. Carbon Credit Portfolio
Provide a portfolio view that shows the user's current holdings of carbon credits and carbon credit ETFs. Display the total value of the portfolio and the performance of individual assets.

### 4. Carbon Credit Analytics
Integrate analytics and data visualization to provide insights into the performance of carbon credit projects. Show trends, comparisons, and key metrics to help users make informed decisions.

### 5. Notification System
Implement a notification system that alerts users about important events, such as project status updates, new investment opportunities, or changes in carbon credit prices.

### 6. Project Details Page
Create a dedicated page for each project that provides more detailed information, including project documents, images, and progress updates. Allow users to leave comments and collaborate on projects.

### 7. Carbon Credit News and Insights
Integrate a news feed or blog section that provides the latest news, articles, and insights related to carbon credits and sustainable investments. Keep users informed about industry trends and developments.

## Conclusion
The Asset Management Dashboard provides a solid foundation for managing carbon credit projects and investments. With the suggested features, the dashboard can be enhanced to offer a comprehensive platform for tracking, trading, and analyzing carbon credits and carbon credit ETFs. The integration of Prisma, Firebase authentication, and Next.js 13 ensures a scalable and secure application architecture.
